This program uses Python's lxml to scrape ESPN's website for NBA game results and player statistics. Then, the data collected in converted into examples which include features and a label. These examples are used to train scikit-learn models to try to predict the players' statistics for their next game. Currently, I am only using a linear model and decision trees, but this may change in the future. Also, currently data is stored in files, which may also change in the future.
